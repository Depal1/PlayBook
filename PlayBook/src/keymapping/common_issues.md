# Common Issues

### Keymap reliability issues are fixed by updating to macOS 13.1. You can ignore the following text if you have the update installed already. 

Occasionally, keymaps may become unresponsive. This may occur if you use `command ⌘` + `tab` to quickly switch between apps before unlocking your mouse. If this occurs there are a couple of steps you can try.

1. Press `option ⌥` to release the mouse, and then press `option ⌥` again to enable keymapping. You may have to do this a couple times to regain control.
2. Use `command ⌘` + `K` to open the Keymapping Editor, and press `command ⌘` + `K` again to close it.
3. If the above doesn't work, restart the app.
4. If the issue persists after restarting the app, save any work you have open and restart your Mac. 

> __NOTE:__ When using shortcuts like `command ⌘` + `Q` to exit apps, the shortcut will not register with keymapping enabled. It may also result in unintended button presses if `Q` is mapped. Before quitting apps with shortcuts, you should therefore release your mouse and disable keymapping with `option ⌥`
